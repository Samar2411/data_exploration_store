# Insights and conclusion:
Based on the results and the created dashboard over the data, the following points reflect the plan for sales for better performance for the upcoming year:

1- Women are more likely to buy and order compared to men by more than 60%.

2- Listed top 3 selling states and top 3 marketing channels controlling the best sales 

3- The adult group in general (whether it is men or women) is more likely to make more purchases than any other category

----> Our main targeted category based on this analysis is adult women (gender and age category that made most purchases) in the top 3 selling states and using the top 3 selling channels by showing ads on these channels.
